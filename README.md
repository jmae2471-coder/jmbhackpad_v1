# jmbhackpad_v1
Hey! This is my first time doing anything like this. I want my hackpad to be an aid in video and picture editing, and maybe even a tool to use in the future as I continue to learn how to code. everything needed should be in the files.

I am using the heat inserts and the screws to put it together. 
BOM:
-4 M3x16mm screws
-4 M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts
-0.91 inch OLED display
-Seeed XIAO RP2040-DIP
-4 blank keycaps
-4 keyboard switches (SW_Push)
-2 RGB LEDS (SK6812 MINI LED)
-2 4.7K resistors 
-3D printed case (top and bottom)

This was a lot of fun to design and create!
